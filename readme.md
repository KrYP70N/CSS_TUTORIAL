# CSS

CSS is a style sheet language used to define the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It dictates how HTML elements should be displayed on a webpage, encompassing aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and animations. With CSS, developers can separate the structure of a webpage from its presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of maintenance.
